## Introduction

This repository hosts solutions to Python assignments covering different topics such as creating a to-do list application, a weather app, an expense tracker, and a chatbot. Each assignment is implemented in Python and includes detailed instructions on how to use the applications.

## Assignments

1. [To-Do List Application](todolist.py): A command-line to-do list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

2. [Weather App](weatherapp.py): A Python program that retrieves weather information using an API and displays it to the user. Users can input a city and get the current weather conditions.

3. [Expense Tracker](expense.py): An expense tracking system where users can input their daily expenses, categorize them, and view spending patterns over time.

4. [Chatbot](chatbot.py): A simple chatbot developed using natural language processing libraries. The chatbot can answer basic questions and engage in a conversation.

## Usage

To use any of the applications, follow the instructions provided in each assignment's README or inline comments in the Python scripts.
